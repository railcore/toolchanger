Railcore Toolchanger
=======

The Railcore Toolchanger is an open source development project evaluating options to incorporate/add new components to the [RailCore II][wiki] to enable “tool changing”. The RailCore II is a Core-XY based Reprap 3D printer designed by J. Steve White & Tony Akens.  The Railcore Toolchanger is a community driven project lead by Eric K Moyer with involvement from Joshua Vasquez, J. Steve White, Tony Akens, several active Railcore community members and Railcore suppliers.

## Support

Have questions about the Railcore Toolchanger? **[Join the Discord! #tool-changing][discord]**.
As documentation/instruction(s) are created, they will be posted to the wiki [here](https://railcore.org/customization/).

## Community Involvement

The Railcore Toolchanger project will only be successful with community involvement to further its development. If you are interested in contributing, there are a number of ways to get involved:

* Review, comment, or add to the **[open issues](https://github.com/railcore/parts/issues)**
* **[Join the Discord! #tool-changing][discord]**

## Assumptions
This project assumes you are starting with a working Railcore printer and performing modifications to that working printer to test these development components.  

## Software
There is currently **NO** explicit software/macros for the Railcore Toolchanger project and one of the first development goals is to port the software/marcos from the Jubilee.  You can find the current repository of Jubliee software/macros [here](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/tree/master/software).

## Disclaimer
This project is still considered in the “alpha” phase of development and we expect not everything to work and fixes/changes will be required. This means new parts will need to be printed and new parts/components/hardware purchased. This is **NOT** a stable or complete configuration ready for general public consumption/use. There will also be minimal assembly documentation during initial development. Future releases will increase and improve on documentation as the exact design configuration is locked down.
**Warning!** The Railcore Toolchanger development project requires 120V mains electricity. Working with mains electricity can be dangerous and we are in no way responsible for any form of damage, injury or death related to use of or deviation from these source files and instructions. Also note that, depending on your country of operation, you may be in closer proximity to 220V mains electricity.

## Sourcing Parts for Railcore Toolchanger Build
The current [Shopping List](add link) and [Parts List](add link) summarizes what components were used to build the current version.  We are working with our current Railcore suppliers to enable an easier way to source parts. The [Discord #tool-changing channel][discord] will be used to share up to date information on the best way to source components.
