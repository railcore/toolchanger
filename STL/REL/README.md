The Railcore Toolchanger uses the remote elastic lock (REL) from Jubilee.  

Joshua Vasquez designed these Railcore specific mounts for his REL design.

This repository only has the Railcore specific mount for the REL.  All other part(s) are from the Jubilee project and are located [here](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=3D_Printed_Parts).

The baseline stepper motor for the REL is LDO 28STH32-0674APG14.  This is the recommended stepper motor for this build.

An alternated stepper motor is Stepper Online 14HS13-0804S-PG5.

* lock_actuator_base_plate_rc

You will need to print(1) each of the following Jubilee parts:
* lock_actuator_motor_clip
* fixed_half_pulley
* floating_half_pulley
