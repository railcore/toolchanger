Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to 
be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 
International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this 
Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the 
Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms 
and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration 
of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material 
available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 - Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar 
   Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and 
   in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, 
   transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission 
   under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For 
   purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a 
   musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is 
   always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed 
   relation with a moving image.

   and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in

c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar 
   rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, 
   performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database 
   Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. 
   For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in 
   Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
   
d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in 
   the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under 
   laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO 
   Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar 
   international agreements.
   
e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or 
   any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights 
   that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
 
f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, 
   or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
   
g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the 
   terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited 
   to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of 
   the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
   
h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights 
   under this Public License.
   
i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or 
   process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such 
   as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, 
   dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material 
   available to the public including in ways that members of the 
   public may access the material from a place and at a time 
   individually chosen by them.
   
j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright 
   resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and 
   of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of 
   databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other 
   essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
   
k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights 
   under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
   
Section 2 - Scope.

a. License grant.
     1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the 
        Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, 
        non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights 
        in the Licensed Material to:
           A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
           B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
     2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions 
        and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, 
        and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
     3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
     4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes 
        You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now 
        known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary 
        to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or 
        authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to 
        exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary 
        to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this 
        Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this 
        Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
     5. Downstream recipients.
          A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the 
             Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor 
             to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of 
             this Public License.
          B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional 
             or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological 
             Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise 
             of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
     6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be 
        construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use 
        of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or 
        granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive 
        attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

b. Other rights.
     1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this 
        Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality 
        rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees 
        not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent 
        necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
     2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
     3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties 
        from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through 
        a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory 
        licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any 
        right to collect such royalties.
